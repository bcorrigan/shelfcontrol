Shelf Control is an epub indexing and browsing web application. It is intended to be very fast at searching huge numbers (ie hundreds of thousands) of epubs while using relatively little system resources, and aimed at people who intend to self host for private use.

It is in a very early stage of development and implemented using rust, tantivy (for searching) and rouille on the server side and Vue.js for the web front end.
